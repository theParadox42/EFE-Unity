Yeah I was originally gonna make the web game into a desktop/mobile game, but the pixel art is kinda trashy, and I have other game ideas I would rather work on, I hope you enjoy the original version you can play [here](https://escapefromearth.tk "Escape From Earth"), but its not going to get any content updates. I also did significantly improve the backend for storing the levels, but it will never be used unless someone like you wants to try to make a game compatible with it. Peace out, check out my later projects, and keep on coding.
